# Bioloid-Dynamixel-AX12A

## Requirements:

**Software:**
```bash
Python 
```

**Import Libraries:**
```bash
matplotlib, NumPy, OpenCV, Tkinter 
```

# Simple testing - control of Dynamixel AX-12A servo motors using Python's own library

The project demonstrates the control of AX-12A servomotors on several examples. Dynamixel doesnâ€™t respond to PWM signals, but a slightly more complicated protocol of instructions for reading and writing onto its memory. This communication happens over a half-duplex UART 
port, using only one wire for both sending and receiving. Control of Dynamixel AX-12A servo 
motors using Python's own library. Communication with the control system is via USB.


## Step no. 1: Control one servo motor
a) TKinter, python animation
b) OpenCV (multiple object tracking), matplotlib


## Step no. 2: Control Bioloid Humanoid
a) OpenCV (multiple object tracking), matplotlib


## Step no. 3: Control King-Spider
a) OpenCV (object tracking), matplotlib
